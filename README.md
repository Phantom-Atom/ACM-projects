# ASCIIfy

ASCII(American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a common encoding format used for representing strings and text data in computers.
I have used ASCII Characters' strings to draw an image by making a character map of ASCII characters in an increasing order of their brightness. I also added colors to the ASCII characters and then saved the output.

Libraries used - Pillow, Math.

# Pencil Sketch Generator

I created a Pencil Sketch of an image using Opencv by first I converting the image into greyscale and then inverting it.
Then I applied a Gaussian Blur to the image and obtained the sketch by performing Bitwise division between the inverted Blurred image and the Grayscale image. Finally, I saved the created Sketch.

Libraries used - OpenCV, Matplotlib.
